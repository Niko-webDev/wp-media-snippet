== Description ==

How to add custom POST and file filtering parameters to wp native media uploader.
Use case: User media uploads from the front-end, when media files mime types and/or sizes vary according to the page or user role.
Adding a custom POST parameter allows to then apply different file restrictions in the wp_handle_upload_prefilter hook.
